# This repo is archived

You can get its contents back by cloning the repository, and reverting the last
commit with \`git revert HEAD\` (or undoing it with \`git reset --hard HEAD^\`).

There is also a git bundle of the repository backed up to AWS S3.

## Why did this happen?

In an effort to keep down the number of private repositories under the Jayway
organization, we archive repositories which are no longer in use.

## What happens next?

Without further notice, this clone of the repository can (and, most likely, will)
be removed. You can still get all its contents back; for instructions, see the
Readme of [the archival bot repository][repo-archive].
